------------------------------------

rollout/ep_len_mean (Episode Length Mean): The average number of steps (time steps) per episode during training.

rollout/ep_rew_mean (Episode Reward Mean): The average reward per episode during training. In the context of 
LunarLander, this often reflects the quality of landings; positive values indicate successful landings, 
while negative values indicate poor landings.

time/fps (Frames Per Second): The number of steps (or interactions with the environment) the model completes per second.

time/iterations (Iterations): The number of training iterations, each comprising the collection of experience data 
and model parameter updates.

time/time_elapsed (Time Elapsed): The time elapsed during training, measured in seconds.

time/total_timesteps (Total Timesteps): The cumulative total number of steps taken during training.

train/entropy_loss (Entropy Loss): The entropy loss during training, used to encourage a more uniform action 
probability distribution, thereby enhancing exploration.

train/explained_variance (Explained Variance): A measure of how well the model explains the variance in the observed 
values. Values closer to 1 indicate better model performance.

train/learning_rate (Learning Rate): The learning rate used during training.

train/n_updates (Number of Updates): The number of parameter updates performed during training.

train/policy_loss (Policy Loss): The policy loss during training, reflecting the model's performance in action selection.

train/value_loss (Value Function Loss): The value function loss during training, indicating how well the model estimates state values.
